Title: Implement Gaussian Process in Stan and Visualize Its First Derivative's Uncertainty Band
Description: gpviz implements Gaussian Process in Stan and calculate the distribution properties of the first derivative of predictions and then visualize the uncertainty band of the first derivative of predictions. One might use the uncertainty band to find the region of independent variable corresponding to dependent variable increasing or decreasing at a certain confidence level. Confidence levels from p=(1-conf)/2 to p=(1+conf)/2 are given for the empirical distribution, and were derived by calculating the first derivative values for sample_dist_n tangent generated configurations.
